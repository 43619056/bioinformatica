00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.540
<v ->Online scammers are increasingly sophisticated</v>

2
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.530
in their attempts to trick unsuspecting victims.

3
00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.060
This trickery perpetrated through email

4
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.030
is known as phishing.

5
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.530
Phishing involves sending fraudulent messages

6
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.640
to gain access to financial accounts or resources,

7
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.140
steal online credentials,

8
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.100
like usernames, passwords, and account numbers,

9
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.970
or spread malware.

10
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.890
While phishing has become more challenging to spot,

11
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.110
it gets easier if you know what you're looking for.

12
00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.970
Let's discuss some common examples of phishing,

13
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.000
how to identify red flags,

14
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.430
and use smart security practices to keep yourself

15
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.563
and your information secure.

16
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.650
Common phishing tactics include

17
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.650
claiming you've won a prize.

18
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:48.610
Posing as a friend,

19
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.650
asking for emergency monetary assistance.

20
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.280
Impersonating a business or government organization

21
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.740
requesting that you verify information

22
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.973
or pretending to offer technical support.

23
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.890
New phishing strategies emerge all the time,

24
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.840
but fraudsters often use tactics like these

25
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.760
that have proven successful in the past.

26
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.270
The common thread among phishing emails

27
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.290
is that they appear to come from a trusted contact

28
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.300
like a friend, a government organization,

29
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.770
or a company with which you do business,

30
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.663
but these messages are anything but trustworthy.

31
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.980
So how do you know if you have a legitimate email

32
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.700
or a phishing attempt in your inbox?

33
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.913
Look for the following six red flags.

34
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.590
Urgent language like, "Act now",

35
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.870
and threats of cancellation or collection,

36
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.830
are phishing attempts to entice you to act quickly,

37
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.540
and without thinking.

38
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.270
Always independently verify contact information

39
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.330
before responding.

40
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.640
Legitimate businesses correspond from the company domain,

41
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.200
and won't share other email addresses.

42
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.620
If you see a strange address in the, "From field"

43
00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.030
or extra addresses in the "To or CC fields"

44
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.253
it might be a scam.

45
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.327
Be wary of generic greetings like,

46
00:02:03.327 --> 00:02:06.230
"Dear user or Dear subscriber."

47
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.160
People you do business with will know your name.

48
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.493
Be suspicious of anyone who doesn't.

49
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.870
Links and downloads that spread malware

50
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.120
are common in phishing emails.

51
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.880
Examine links and attachments before clicking.

52
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.450
Or better yet, don't click at all.

53
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.980
Scammers don't always take time to proof-read,

54
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.430
and often write messages in non-native languages.

55
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.440
So beware of correspondence with typos, errors,

56
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.570
or strange phrasing.

57
00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.750
Finally, messages that ask for account numbers,

58
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.440
usernames, passwords, social security numbers,

59
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.800
or any other private information are red flags.

60
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.543
Never provide sensitive data through email.

61
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.920
Besides being familiar with red flags

62
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.460
that indicate a scam,

63
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.310
practice smart security habits online.

64
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.890
That way, if you do fall prey to phishing,

65
00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.603
you'll have protections in place.

66
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.420
Stay informed about current phishing techniques,

67
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.560
and report phishing attempts to your technical support team

68
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.790
or through your local government reporting website.

69
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.680
Install antivirus software,

70
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.430
and perform routine scans to keep your system protected.

71
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.810
If you inadvertently download malware,

72
00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.450
running a scan can detect,

73
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.603
and usually remove the threat.

74
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.480
Don't ignore notifications to update your browsers

75
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.360
and operating system.

76
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.710
These updates provide important patches

77
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.580
to address security issues,

78
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.323
including vulnerabilities scammers try to exploit.

79
00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.010
Use strong, unique passwords on all your accounts,

80
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.530
and enable two-factor or multifactor authentication,

81
00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:43.530
to make it difficult

82
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.530
for scammers to access your online accounts.

83
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.610
And remember, a healthy dose of skepticism

84
00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.600
is a good thing online.

85
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.970
If your gut tells you something is off,

86
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.743
take time to investigate.

87
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.350
When cybercriminals send phishing emails,

88
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.160
they hope you'll act quickly without much thought.

89
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.600
Don't take the bait.

90
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.270
Instead, take time to look for red flags

91
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.170
and establish smart security habits

92
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.483
to keep your information and accounts safe.
