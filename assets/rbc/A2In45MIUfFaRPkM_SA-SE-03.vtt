00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.220
<v ->Which type of email do you think is a cybersecurity risk,</v>

2
00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.530
an email from a stranger or your boss?

3
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.820
That's a trick question.

4
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.790
The answer is both.

5
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.280
Most of us know to be wary of email requests

6
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.010
and links from strangers,

7
00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.310
yet we don't always consider the risks

8
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.260
when communicating with people we know.

9
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.770
Business email compromise, or BEC for short,

10
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.360
is an email phishing scam in which attackers

11
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.530
impersonate a vendor, high-level executive,

12
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.160
or another known contact to trick victims

13
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.353
into sending money or revealing sensitive information.

14
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.230
Email compromise and impersonation

15
00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.000
costs companies millions every year.

16
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.410
So, how do these scams work

17
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.683
and what warning signs should you watch for?

18
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.760
There are five main types of BEC scams.

19
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.560
Understanding these common techniques

20
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.453
can help you spot and avoid them.

21
00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.880
With CEO fraud,

22
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.290
an attacker masquerades as a CEO

23
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.639
or other high-level executive to fool an employee

24
00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:06.193
into giving up information or money.

25
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.600
Fake invoice schemes involve sending fraudulent invoices

26
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.670
that appear to come from a legitimate vendor,

27
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.803
supplier, or business partner.

28
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.860
Account compromise happens when an attacker

29
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.100
hacks the email account of an executive

30
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.973
or other high-ranking employee.

31
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.340
As you might guess,

32
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.860
attorney impersonation occurs when a cybercriminal poses

33
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.370
as a lawyer or other legal representative

34
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.563
to access company funds or data.

35
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.260
Finally, data theft scams often target employees

36
00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.210
in human resources and attempt to solicit tax

37
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.390
or personal information

38
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.470
about company executives or employees.

39
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.740
Successful thieves can use this information

40
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.203
to carry out more sophisticated social engineering attacks.

41
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.390
Fraudulent emails can be highly convincing.

42
00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.060
Attackers may gather information about their targets

43
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.030
so they can reference insider details

44
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.500
about company accounts, people, or calendars,

45
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.090
making requests sound more legitimate.

46
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.460
They also often use fake email addresses

47
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.800
or lookalike domains that mimic the real thing.

48
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.390
But that's not the only reason BEC attacks

49
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.020
are so successful.

50
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.120
Attackers also exploit people's response to authority.

51
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.350
Low-level or mid-level employees are less likely

52
00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.253
to question requests that appear to come from higher-ups.

53
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.970
So, beyond knowing the risks and types of BEC scams,

54
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.240
what else can you do to recognize and stop attacks?

55
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.930
Know the warning signs.

56
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.140
Here are five red flags.

57
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.190
First, be alert if you receive any requests

58
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.090
from a high-level executive involving financial payment

59
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.640
or sensitive employee information.

60
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.250
Ask yourself, "Is this a common request?

61
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.350
Does this person typically email me directly?

62
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.500
Is this the standard process and channel

63
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.720
for handling this type of request?"

64
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.360
If you answered no to any of these questions,

65
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.373
then the email may be compromised.

66
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.020
You can also spot impersonators

67
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.920
by inspecting sender email addresses.

68
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.250
Don't trust emails in which the from, reply to,

69
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.100
or display name fields don't match.

70
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.130
Also, look closely for slight modifications

71
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.583
to a legitimate email address or domain.

72
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.460
For example, if an executive's legitimate email address

73
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.710
is john@glivy.com,

74
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.210
an attacker might create a near identical email address,

75
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.730
for example swapping the letter I in Glivy

76
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:33.853
with the number one.

77
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.350
An email's tone can also tip you off to fraudulent requests.

78
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.740
Urgent or confidential requests are red flags.

79
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.860
Attackers try to manipulate targets into acting quickly

80
00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.270
and without asking questions.

81
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.270
Fourth, be suspicious of unsolicited or unusual invoices.

82
00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.810
Always inspect an invoice carefully before paying it.

83
00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.710
Were you expecting this invoice?

84
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.980
Does the invoice date, account number, contact information,

85
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.820
and payment amount match your records

86
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.310
and appear legitimate?

87
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.740
If in doubt, visit the vendor in person

88
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.803
or call them over the phone to verify.

89
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.500
Finally, take a closer look at emails written

90
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.220
in broken English or with typos, grammar,

91
00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.120
and spelling mistakes.

92
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.410
An email using European spellings,

93
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.546
sentence structures, or date formats

94
00:04:22.546 --> 00:04:25.340
should sound alarms if it supposedly comes

95
00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.653
from an American employee or company.

96
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.170
Email impersonators can be challenging to detect.

97
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.330
Armed with company information and fake email addresses,

98
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.160
these cybercriminals send highly convincing emails

99
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.393
that seem like legitimate business requests.

100
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.570
To safeguard against business email compromise scams,

101
00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.870
remember these key takeaways.

102
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.010
Familiarize yourself with the five types of BEC

103
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.890
so that you can recognize and avoid them.

104
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.400
Carefully inspect any email containing

105
00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.375
a financial or sensitive information request,

106
00:04:58.375 --> 00:05:00.710
even if it appears to come from your boss

107
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.740
or another executive.

108
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.720
And finally, don't wait to tell your supervisor

109
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.640
or IT department about attempted

110
00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.513
or successful cyberattacks.

111
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.840
With awareness and vigilance,

112
00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.100
you can block attempted BEC attacks

113
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.450
and avoid inadvertently funding cybercriminals.
